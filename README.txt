# QWeuRTY

The truly pan-European keyboard layout.

## Design goals

From the French "ç" to the Portuguese "ã", the Asturian "ḥ" to the Icelandic "ð", the Spanish "ñ" to the Irish "í", the Swedish "å" to the Dutch "ĳ", the German "ß" to the Czech "ř", the Polish "ł" to the Lithuanian "ą", the Hungarian "ő" to the Turkish "ı" and much more, QWERTY was designed to enable the input of every character used by every European language that uses the Latin script. Like the so-called “international keyboard layouts”, it turns all the accent keys (and a few more) into dead keys to input the most common diacritic marks. The `AltGr` (on PC) or `Opt` (on Mac) layer is also used to input useful symbols.

## Usage

QWeuRTY uses nine dead keys:

- <code>\`</code> for the grave accent and the breves;
- `~` for the tilde;
- `^` for the circumflex accent;
- `'` for the acute and double acute accents;
- `"` for the dieresis and double grave accent;
- `\\` for the caron;
- `|` for the macron and stroked characters;
- `§` for the cedilla and the ogonek;
- and `±` for the dot.

To type an "é", for example, you first type `'` to activate the acute accent layer, then `e`. To type `'`, you can simply press `'` twice. Some characters, such as `ð` or `æ`, are placed on the `AltGr/Opt` layer as they don’t fit neatly into the various accent layers.
