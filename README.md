# QWeuRTY

The truly pan-European QWERTY layout.

## Design goals

From the French ‘ç’ to the Portuguese ‘ã’, the Asturian ‘ḥ’ to the Icelandic ‘ð’, the Spanish ‘ñ’ to the Irish ‘í’, the Swedish ‘å’ to the Dutch ‘ĳ’, the German ‘ß’ to the Czech ‘ř’, the Polish ‘ł’ to the Lithuanian ‘ą’, the Hungarian ‘ő’ to the Turkish ‘ı’ and much more, QWeuRTY lets you type every character in every Latin-script European language straight from a QWERTY keyboard.

Like every other international layout, QWeuRTY leans heavily on dead keys for the most common diacritics. The `AltGr` (on PC) or `Opt` (on Mac) layer is also used to input useful symbols. QWeuRTY works best on a 105-key ISO keyboard, though it’ll do in a pinch on a 104-key ANSI one, albeit with reduced functionality.

## Usage

QWeuRTY uses nine dead keys:

- <code>\`</code> for the grave accent and breves;
- `~` for the tilde;
- `^` for the circumflex;
- `'` for the acute and double acute accents;
- `"` for the diaeresis and double grave accent;
- `\` for the caron;
- `|` for the macron and stroked characters;
- `§` for the cedilla and the ogonek;
- and `±` for the dot.

To type an ‘é’, for example, you first type `'` to activate the acute accent layer, then `e`. To type `'`, you can simply press `'` twice. Some characters, such as `ð` or `æ`, are placed on the `AltGr/Opt` layer as they don’t fit neatly into the various accent layers.

## Installation

Use the appropriate files in the repo to manually install QWeuRTY on your system. Packages with installation scripts will be available with QWeuRTY 1.0.

## Layers

Keys marked with `●` aren’t defined, but might be in the future. From QWeuRTY 1.0 onwards, keys shouldn’t change unless there’s overwhelming support to do so.

## Help wanted

I’ve been using QWeuRTY since 2020, so i know it’s working well on ISO keyboards and adequately on ANSI keyboards. I have provisional Colemak and Workman versions working, but i’d like to be sure they’re logical and ergonomic. If you can help, send me an e-mail at <anthony@nelzin.fr>. Thanks!
